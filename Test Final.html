				The company was bought by the American discount store chain Kmart in 2005, which was in bankruptcy at the time and renamed itself Sears Holdings upon completion of the merger. 
				In terms of domestic revenue, Sears was the largest retailer in the United States until October 1989, when it was surpassed by Walmart.
				It is the fifth-largest American department store company by sales as of October 2013 behind Walmart, Target, Best Buy, and Home Depot,
				and it is the twelfth-largest retailer in the country overall. It operates divisions in Canada and Mexico, among several subsidiaries within its brand.
